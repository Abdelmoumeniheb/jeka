## Files

File manipulation is a central part for building software. 
Jeka embraces JDK7 *java.nio.file* API by adding some concepts around, to provide a powerful fluent style API performing 
recurrent tasks with minimal effort. 

### Classes from Jeka File API

The following classes lie in `dev.jeka.core.api.file` package: 

* `JkPathFile` A simple wrapper for files (not folders). It provides copying, interpolation, checksum, deletion and creation methods.
   
* `JkPathSequence` An Immutable sequence of `java.nio.file.Path` providing methods for filtering or appending.

* `JkPathMatcher` An immutable `java.nio.file.PathMatcher` based on `java.nio.file` glob pattern or regerxp.
Used by `JkPathTree` to filter in/out files according name patterns.

* `JkPathTree` An Immutable root folder (or a zip file) along a `PathMatcher` providing operations to copy, navigate, zip or iterate. 
This is a central class in Jeka API.
   
* `JkPathTreeSet` An Immutable set of `JkPathTree`. Helpful to define set of sources/resources and create jar/zip files.

* `JkResourceProcessor` A mutable processor for copying a set of files, preserving the structure and 
 replacing some text by other text. Typically, used for replacing token as `${server.ip}` by an actual value. 

### Examples

```Java
// creates a file and writes the content of the specified url.
JkPathFile.of("config/my-config.xml").createIfNotExist().replaceContentBy("http://myserver/conf/central.xml");

// copies all non java source files to another directory preserving structure
JkPathTree.of("src").andMatching(false, "**/*.java").copyTo("build/classes");

```
