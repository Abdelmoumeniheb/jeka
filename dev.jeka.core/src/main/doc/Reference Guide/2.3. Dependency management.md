## Dependency Management

### Concepts

#### What is a dependency ?

For Jeka, a _dependency_ is something that can be resolved to a set of files by a `JkDependencyResolver`.
Generally a dependency resolves to 1 file (or folder) but it can be 0 or many.

A dependency is always an instance of `JkDependency`.

Jeka distinguishes mainly 3 types of dependency :

* __Arbitrary files__ located on the file system (represented by `JkFileSystemDependency` class). These files are assumed to be present on the file system when the build is running.
* __Files produced by a computation__ (represented by `JkComputedDependency` class). These files may be present on file system or not. If they are not present, the computation is run in order to produce the missing files. Generally the computation stands for the build of an external project.
* __Reference to module__ (represented by `JkModuleDependency`) hosted in a binary repository (Ivy or Maven for instance) : Jeka can consume and resolve transitively any artifact located in a repository as you would do with Maven, Ivy or Gradle.

For the last, Jeka is using _Ivy 2.5.0_ under the hood. 
Jeka jar embeds Ivy and executes it in a dedicated classloader to be hidden for client code.

#### What is transitivity ?

Mainstream build tools use a single concept ('scope' or 'configuration') to determine both :
1. which part of the build needs the dependency
2. which transitive dependencies to fetch along the dependency.   

This confusion leads in dependency management systems that are un-flexible and/or difficult to reason about.
Gradle comes with a confusing myriad of 'configurations' for covering numerous use case combo, while Maven narrows 
'scopes' to a fewer less but with limitations and not-so-clear transitivity rules.

In the opposite, Jeka distinguishes clearly the two purposes :
1. Jeka uses distinct dependency set instances for each part of the build (compile, runtime, test,...). Each can be 
defined relatively to another one using set theory operations. 
2. For each dependency, we can decide its transitivity, that is, the transitive dependencies that we fetch along.

Jeka, defines by default 3 levels of transitivity : 
- NONE : Not transitive
- COMPILE : Only transitive dependencies declared with scope 'compile' in the dependency published pom.
- RUNTIME : All dependencies declared in the dependency published pom.

Reminder : on Maven repositories, published poms can declare only two scopes for transitive dependencies : 'compile' 
and 'runtime'.

For Ivy repositories, it is possible to declare a specific transitivity that maps to a slave 'configuration'.

The below example shows a Java project declaration using explicit transitivity.

```Java
JkJavaProject.of().simpleFacade()
    .setCompileDependencies(deps -> deps
            .and("com.google.guava:guava:23.0", JkTransitivity.NONE)
            .and("javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1"))
    .setRuntimeDependencies(deps -> deps
            .and("org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.19")
            .withTransitivity("com.google.guava:guava", JkTransitivity.RUNTIME)
            .minus("javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api"))
    .setTestDependencies(deps -> deps
            .and(Hint.first(), "org.mockito:mockito-core:2.10.0")
    )
```
It results in :
```
Declared Compile Dependencies : 2 elements.
  com.google.guava:guava:23.0 transitivity:NONE
  javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1
Declared Runtime Dependencies : 2 elements.
  com.google.guava:guava:23.0 transitivity:RUNTIME
  org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.19
Declared Test Dependencies : 4 elements.
  org.mockito:mockito-core:2.10.0
  com.google.guava:guava:23.0 transitivity:RUNTIME
  org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.19
  javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1
```
The dependencies without any transitivity specified on, will take default transitivity for 
their purpose, namely COMPILE for compile dependencies, and RUNTIME for runtime and test dependencies.

The API allows to redefine the transitivity declared in a upper dependency set.

Note that transitivity can only apply to `JkModuleDependency` (like <i>com.google.guava:guava:23.0</i>) 
and `JkLocalProjectDependency`.

### Define a set of dependencies

To define a set of dependencies (typically the dependencies of the project to build), you basically define a set of _scoped dependencies_.

The set of scoped dependencies concept is represented by `JkDependencySet` class. This class provides a fluent API for easier instantiation. 

```Java
import static dev.jeka.core.api.depmanagement.JkScopes.*;
...
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and("com.google.guava") 
    .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple")
    .and("com.orientechnologies:orientdb-client:2.0.8")
    .andFile("../libs.myjar")
    .withVersionProvider(myVersionProvider);
```

Note that :

* Module version and scopes can be omitted when declaring dependencies. Versions can be provided by a `JkVersionProvider` 
and scopes can be defaulted.

* Instances of `JkDependencySet` can be combined together in order to construct large dependencySet from smaller ones.

* `JkDependencySet#ofTextDescription` provides a mean to instantiate a dependency set from a simple text as :
```
- COMPILE RUNTIME
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

- RUNTIME
com.h2database:h2
org.liquibase:liquibase-core
com.oracle:ojdbc6:12.1.0

- TEST
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test
org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-chrome-driver:3.4.0
org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-assertj:3.2.0
org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-junit:3.2.0

- PROVIDED
org.projectlombok:lombok:1.16.16
```
     

#### Dependencies on Module

This is for declaring a dependency on module hosted in _Maven_ or _Ivy_ repository. Basically you instantiate a `JkModuleDepency` from it's group, name and version.

```Java
    JkDependencySet.of()
        .and(JkPopularModule.GUAVA, "18.0")
        .and("com.orientechnologies:orientdb-client:[2.0.8, 2.1.0[")
        .and("mygroup:mymodule:myclassifier:0.2-SNAPSHOT");
```
There is many way to indicate a module dependency, see Javadoc for browsing possibilities. 

Note that :
* A version ending by `-SNAPSHOT` has a special meaning : Jeka will consider it _"changing"_. This means that it won't cache it locally and will download the latest version from repository.  
* As Jeka relies on Ivy under the hood, it accepts dynamic versions as mentioned [here](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/dependency.html).
* Dependency files are downloaded in _[USER HOME]_/.jeka/cache/repo

#### Dependencies on local files

You just have to mention the path of one or several files. If one of the files does not exist at resolution time (when the dependency is actually retrieved), build fails.

```Java
    JkDependencySet of()
        .andFile("libs/my.jar")
        .andFile("libs/my.testingtool.jar", TEST);
    }
		
``` 

#### Dependencies on files produced by computation

It is typically used for _multi-modules_ or _multi-techno_ projects.

The principle is that if the specified files are not found, then the computation is run in order to generate the missing files.
If some files still missing after the computation has run, the build fails.

This mechanism is quite simple yet powerful as it addresses following use cases :

* Dependencies on files produced by an artifact producer (`JkArtifactProducer`). A Jeka Java project is an artifact producer.
* Dependencies on files produced by external project built with any type of technology (Ant, Grunt, Maven, Gradle, SBT, Android SDK, Make, ...).
* Dependencies on files produced by any means.   

The generic way is to construct this kind of dependency using a `java.lang.Runnable`.

The following snippet constructs a set of dependencies on two external projects : one is built with Maven, the other with 
_Jeka_. 
```Java
Path mavenProject = Paths.get("../a-maven-project");
JkProcess mavenBuild = JkProcess.of("mvn", "clean", "install").withWorkingDir(mavenProject);
Path mavenProjectJar = mavenProject.resolve("target/maven-project.jar");
JkJavaProject externalProject = JkJavaProject.ofSimple(Paths.get("../a-jeka-project")); 
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and(JkComputedDependency.of(mavenBuild, mavenProjectJar))
    .and(externalProject);
```

### Resolve Dependencies

The `JkDependencyResolver` class is responsible JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral());to resolve dependencies by returning `JkResolveResult` from a 
`JkdependencySet`. 

```java
JkDependencySet deps =  JkDependencySet
                            .of("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.3")
                            .andFile("libs/my.jar");

// Module dependencies are fetched from Maven central repo
JkDependencyResolver resolver = JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral());  
JkResolveResult result = resolver().resolve(deps);
```

From the result you can : 

* Navigate in the resolved dependency tree as :

```java
JkDependencyNode slfjApiNodeDep = result.getDependencyTree().getFirst(JkModuleId.of("org.slf4j:slf4j-api"));
System.out.println(slfjApiNode.getModuleInfo().getResolvedVersion());
```

* Get the direct list of artifact files

```java
JkPathSequence sequence = result.getFiles();  
sequence.forEach(System.out::println); // print each files part of the dependency resolution
```

* Resolve for a given scope

The following snippets captures the resolved dependency files for COMPILE scope. Junit is excluded from this result.
```
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
    .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);
    
Iterable<Path> files = JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral()).resolve(COMPILE).getFiles();
```

### Publication

Jeka is able to publish on both Maven and Ivy repository. This includes repositories as [Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/) or [Jfrog Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/).

Maven and Ivy have different publication model, so Jeka proposes specific APIs according you want to publish on a Maven or Ivy repository. 

#### Publish to a Maven repository

Jeka proposes a complete API to pubish on Maven repository. POM files will be generated by Jeka according 
provided elements.

The following snippet demonstrate a pretty sophisticated publishing on Maven :

```java
    JkVersionedModule versionedModule = JkVersionedModule.of("org.myorg:mylib:1.2.6");
    JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
            .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
            .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);
    JkMavenPublication mavenPublication = JkMavenPublication.of(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib.jar"))

            // the following are optional but required to publish on public repositories.
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-sources.jar"), "sources")
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-javadoc.jar"), "javadoc")
            .withChecksums("sha-2", "md5")
            .withSigner(JkPgp.of(Paths.get("myPubring"), Paths.get("mySecretRing"), "mypassword"))
            .with(JkMavenPublicationInfo.of("My sample project",
                    "A project to demonstrate publishing on Jeka",
                    "http://project.jeka.org")
                    .andApache2License()
                    .andDeveloper("djeang", "myemail@gmail.com", "jeka.org", "http://project.jeka.org/"));

    // A complex case for repo (credential + signature + filtering) 
    JkRepo repo = JkRepo.of("http://myserver/myrepo")
            .withOptionalCredentials("myUserName", "myPassword")
            .with(JkRepo.JkPublishConfig.of()
                        .withUniqueSnapshot(false)
                        .withNeedSignature(true)
                        .withFilter(mod -> // only accept SNAPSHOT and MILESTONE
                            mod.getVersion().isSnapshot() || mod.getVersion().getValue().endsWith("MILESTONE")
                        ));
    
    // Actually publish the artifacts
    JkPublisher publisher = JkPublisher.of(repo);
    publisher.publishMaven(versionedModule, mavenPublication, deps);
```

Notice that Jeka allows to :

- Publish more than one artifact.
- Produce & publish checksum files for each published artifact.
- Mention to use unique snapshot ([What is it ?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1243574/how-to-stop-maven-artifactory-from-keeping-snapshots-with-timestamps)).
- Feed generated pom with data necessary to publish on [central repository](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html).
- Sign published artifact with PGP
- Publish to multiple repository by creating the publisher using a `JkRepoSet` instead of a `JkRepo`.

To sign with PGP, no need to have PGP installed on Jeka machine. Jeka uses <a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/">Bouncy Castle</a> internally to sign artifacts.

#### Publish to a Ivy repository

Publishing on Ivy repo is pretty similar than on Maven though there is specific options to Ivy. 

```java
    JkVersionedModule versionedModule = JkVersionedModule.of("org.myorg:mylib:1.2.6-SNAPSHOT");
    JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
            .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
            .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);

    JkIvyPublication publication = JkIvyPublication.of(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib.jar"), "master")
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-sources.jar"));

    JkRepo repo = JkRepo.ofIvy(Paths.get("ivyrepo"));

    JkPublisher publisher = JkPublisher.of(repo);
    publisher.publishIvy(versionedModule, publication, deps, JkJavaDepScopes.DEFAULT_SCOPE_MAPPING,
            Instant.now(), JkVersionProvider.of());
```
