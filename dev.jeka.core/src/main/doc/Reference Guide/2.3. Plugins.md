## Plugins

Jeka provides a plugable architecture. In Jeka, a plugin is a class extending `JkPlugin` and named as *JkPlugin[PluginName]*.
The plugin name is inferred from Plugin class name.

Each plugin instance is owned by a JkRun object, and can access to it through `JkPlugin#run` protected field.

Plugins has 3 capabilities :
* Access to their owning JkRun instance (so potentially modify it, load/modify other plugins)
* Expose _run methods_ and _options_ to command line.
* Provide self documentation.

Jeka is bundled with a bunch plugins (java, scaffold, eclipse, intellij, ...) but one can add extra plugins just 
by adding the jar or directory containing the plugin class to your _run classpath_. 

To see all available plugins in the _run classpath_, just execute `jeka help`.
See [Command Line Parsing](#CommandLineParsing) and [Run Class Pre-processing](#RunClassPre-processing(Import3rdpartylibraryintoRunClasspath))
to augment _run_classpath_ .

### Load Plugins

Plugins need not to be mentioned in _run class_ code in order to be bound to the JkRun instance. Just the fact to 
mention a plugin _run method_, _options_ or _[pluginName]#_ in the command line will load the plugin.

For example `jeka scaffold#run java#` will load 'java' and 'scaffold' plugins into a JkRun instance. 
'java' plugin instance will modify 'scaffold' plugin instance in such it produces a run class code extending `JkJavaProjectBuild` 
instead of 'JkRun' when 'scaffold#run' command is executed. It also creates Java project layout folders. See `activate` method in [JkPluginJava Code](https://github.com/jeka/jeka/blob/master/org.jeka.core/src/main/java/org/jeka/tool/builtins/java/JkPluginJava.java) 
to have a concrete view.

You can also force a plugin to load in your _run class_ code as below. That way, you don't need to mention `java#` in command line.

```Java
public class MyBuild extends JkRun {
    
    MyBuild() {
        getPlugin(JkPluginJava.class);  // Loads 'java' plugins in this instance, a second call on 'plugins().get(JkPluginJava.class)' will return same instance.
        getPlugin("intellij");   // You can also load plugin by mentioning its name but it's slower cause it involves classpath scanning
    }
    
}
```

### Modify Owing JkRun Instance

JkRun instances are created using `JkRun#of` factory method. This method invoke `JkPlugin#active` method on all plugin loaded in the JkRun instance.
By default, this method does nothing but plugin implementations can override it in order to let the plugin modify its owning JkRun or owe of its plugins.

In fact, many plugins act just as modifier/enhancer of other plugins. 

For example, [Jacoco Plugin](https://github.com/jeka/jeka/blob/master/org.jeka.core/src/main/java/org/jeka/tool/builtins/jacoco/JkPluginJacoco.java) 
does not provide _run method_ but configures 'java' plugin in such unit tests are forked on a JVM with Jacoco agent on. 
It also provides a utility class `JKocoJunitEnhancer` that supplies lower level features to launch Jacoco programmatically.

Some other plugins does not modify their owning JkRun instance, for example [Scaffold Plugin](https://github.com/jeka/jeka/blob/master/org.jeka.core/src/main/java/org/jeka/tool/builtins/scaffold/JkPluginScaffold.java) 
does not override `activate` method, therefore it has no side effect on its owning `JkRun` instance. It only features _run methods_  along _options_.


### Configure Plugins in JkRun Class

There is three places where you can configure plugins :
* In `JkRun` subclass constructor : at this point options has yet been injected so it's the place to configure default option values.
* In `JkRun#setup` subclass method : at this point, options has been injected but plugins has not been activated yet. 
  It is the place to configure plugins and other instance member to take options in account.
* In `JkRun#postPluginSetup` subclass method : at this point plugins has been activated. If you wan't to override 
some values plugins may have set, override this method.

Example of configuring a plugin in _run class_.

```Java
    ...
    public MyBuild() {
        JkPluginSonar sonarPlugin = getPlugin(JkPluginSonar.class);  // Load sonar plugin 
		sonarPlugin.prop(JkSonar.BRANCH, "myBranch");  // define a default for sonar.branch property
        ...
    }
```
[Jeka own build class](https://github.com/jeka/jeka/blob/master/org.jeka.core/jeka/def/org/jeka/CoreBuild.java) makes a good example.

### Document Plugins

Plugin writers can embed self-documentation using `@JkDoc` annotation on classes, run methods and public fields.

Writers can also mention that the plugin has dependencies on other plugins using `@JkDocPluginDeps` annotation. This annotation 
has only a documentation purpose and does not has influence on plugin loading mechanism.

A good example is [*Java Plugin*](https://github.com/jeka/jeka/blob/master/org.jeka.core/src/main/java/org/jeka/tool/builtins/java/JkPluginJava.java)
