# Welcome to JeKa! 

## Jeka 0.11 is coming

Jeka 0.11 introduces significant changes and new features:

* The API has undergone substantial changes for increased consistency.
* Major improvements have been made to the command-line interface.
* Log output formatting has been greatly enhanced.
* The project folder structures have been refined.
* JDK management has been automated, eliminating the need for users to install and switch between different Java versions.
* A new feature allows for applications to be run directly from sources hosted in remote Git directories.

## JeKa 0.10 is still there

JeKa 0.10 is of course still usable and your builds will be protected thanks to the wrapper mechanism.
