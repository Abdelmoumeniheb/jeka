## Coding Rules

If you want to help Jeka, follow one rule: copy our current style. 

Here's what you need to know:
* Only make a class public if you need to. If a class is public, use `Jk` at the start of the name. This keeps the auto-complete in IDEs clear when using Jeka.
* Use a fluent-style API.
* Don't use other third-party things (You can use or add to JkUtilsXxxxx classes for shared things).
* Jeka must work with JDK8.

Anybody can help Jeka. It's a new project with lots of ways to help. 
You can add to or debug the Jeka project. You can also create plugins to make Jeka work better with your favorite tools. It's not hard and even a little code can help a lot.
