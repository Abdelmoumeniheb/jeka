# Welcome to JeKa

JeKa is a modern build tool for Java, designed to simplify and streamline your development experience. 
In a world where developers seek lightweight, accessible and powerfull solutions, JeKa reimagines what building Java applications can be.

### Next-Gen Java Build Tool
Java is evolving to become more developer- and cloud-native-friendly. Developers no longer want to deal with heavy tools, 
verbose XML configurations, or external DSLs. JeKa aligns with this vision by offering:

- **Simplicity at its Core**: Configure with properties or pure Javaâ€”no XML, no YAML, no DSL.
- **No Setup Hassle**: Start building regular or cloud-native applications immediately, with minimal configuration and requirements.
- **Gradual Complexity**: Handle advanced scenarios using intuitive mechanisms without unnecessary complexity.
- **DevOps Bridge**: Implement complex pipeline logic with robust Java and share it across your teams.

### Ready to explore?

The easiest way to get started is by using the [IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24505-jeka). 
You don't need to install *JeKa* for that.

1. Start a [new project](images/new-project-snapshot.png) and play with the scaffolded example.  
You can have a brief look at the [tutorial](tutorials/getting-started.md) to get an idea of what you can do.

2. You can create projects in the IDE using *Project - Java App/Lib* or *Project - Springboot* templates. They scaffold basic projects, providing code and build instructions in `README.md` files.

3. Explore and experiment with  [examples](examples.md).

Have fun !
