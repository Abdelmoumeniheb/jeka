# Welcome to Jeka


### Jeka directory content 

This directory contains everything Jeka needs to automate or build this project.

In this directory, you may find :
  * __def__ (directory - optional) : This is where lie Java and/or Kotlin sources that will be executed by the automation engine.
  * __output__ (directory - generated) : Files produced by the build (jar, classes, reports, ...) are supposed to be generated here.
  * __boot__ (directory - optional) : All jars located here are added to the build classpath and can therefore be used by the classes defined in *def*.
  * __wrapper__ (directory - optional) : Contains wrapper jar file for bootstrapping Jeka along its configuration.
  * __.work__ (directory - generated): temp files generated by Jeka internal engine are located here. Sources from _def_ are compiled here.
  * __options.properties__ (file - optional) : May contains configuration default defined at project level.
  * __cmd.properties__ (file - optional) : Contains predefined commands that can be invoked with a single keyword.

Depending on your needs, feel free to store any build related elements in this directory.

Besides, project root may also contain _jekaw_ and _jekaw.bat_ shell script to invoke jeka wrapper conveniently.

### Useful commands 

* `jeka help` : Displays on console all methods and options invokable from command line.
* `jeka [pugin-name]#help` : Displays on consoles all methods and option invokable for the specified plugin (e.g. `jeka scaffold#help`).
* `jeka intellij#iml` : Generate iml file for Intellij in order the project can be used in intellij. It is generated according the dependencies declared for this project.
* `jeka intellij#iml -JKC=` : If the above fail cause your def classes do not compile, using `-JKC=` avoid def compilation phase.
* `jeka eclipse#files` : Same purpose as above to generate metadata files for Eclipse.
* `jeka scaffold#run` : Generate files for creating a basic Jeka project from scratch.
* `jeka scaffold#run scaffold#wrap` : Same as above + generating wrapper files (jekaw/jekaw.bat and bootstrap jar)
* `jeka scaffold#run java#` : Generate files for creating a Jeka project for building a JVM language project
