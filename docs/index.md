# Welcome to JeKa

_JeKa_ is a general purpose build tool, that is designed to be a library and an automation engine. 

Users simply write build logic with plain Java or Kotlin classes, then they can invoke their code directly from the command line.

JeKa is bundled with a bunch of pre-configured objects (KBeans) that let the users perform common complex tasks (build, test coverage, code analysis,...) with no additional code (just a minimalist property file).

This approach provides several benefits that developers love : _flexibility, lightness, transparency, discoverability_ and _extendability._ 

In addition, Jeka tries to keep its cognitive load low, introducing a minimal set of concepts. Good skills in Java/Kotiln should be 
enough to achieve builds and pipelines of any complexity.

Last but not least, _Jeka_ is very lightweight (less than 1Mb) and has zero dependencies, making it user-friendly as a simple library.
