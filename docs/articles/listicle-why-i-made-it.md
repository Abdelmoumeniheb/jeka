# 5 reasons why I created JeKa

## 1. Execute Java code directly
   When automating a Java projects, you might have been frustrated of not being 
   able to do it easily. Moreover, using extra languages comes with their own issues.

   *Why not just write Java code and execute it ?*

   JeKa make it possible to execute Java source code directly from IDE or command-line, whatever  
   it is a single-file or multi-files structure, containing dependencies or not.

   Now, I can elaborate my build and deployment using Java, exactly as I do for my production code.
   

## 2. Build Projects using dumb simple Java 
   I wanted to be able to build projects exactly as I run a Java method on IDE : run/debug transparently 
   in IDE.

   JeKa contains a build library along a reusable component model to make it a first-class build tool. 

   With JeKaa, I can easily model and implement full CI/CD pipelines in Java, launch them from anywhere, or debug them in IDE.

## 3. Simple Reusable Components
   
   
   

## 3. Few configuration as possible
   JeKa proposes sensitive defaults to avoid unneeded configuration.
   Configuration is expressed in a concise property file but can also be accessed directly by Java API.
   

## 5. Make Java Simpler
