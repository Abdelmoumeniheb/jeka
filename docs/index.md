# Welcome to JeKa! 

We're glad you're here. 

On this site, you'll find comprehensive reference guides, tutorials, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) about using Jeka.

The reference guide for Jeka provides detailed information on the tool's two main functions, the execution engine and 
the build library. The execution engine allows for direct execution of Java/Kotlin source code, while the build library
enables the building of projects.

We hope that you'll find the information you need to take your Java/Kotlin projects to the next level.
