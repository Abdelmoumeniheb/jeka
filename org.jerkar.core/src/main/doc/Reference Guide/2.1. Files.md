## Files

File manipulation is a central part of building software. 
Jerkar embraces JDK7 *java.nio.file* API by adding some concept around and provides a powerful fluent style API to perform 
recurrent tasks with minimal effort. 

The following classes lie in `org.jerkar.api.file` package : 

* `JkPathFile` : A simple wrapper around  for file (not folder) with copy, content interpolation, 
   checksum, deletion, creation features.
   
* `JkPathSequence` : A list of `java.nio.file.Path`.

* `JkPathMatcher` : A `java.nio.file.PathMatcher` based on `java.nio.file` glob pattern or regerxp.

* `JkPathTree` : A root folder (or a zip file) along a `PathMatcher` providing operations as copy, navigate, zip, iterate.
   This central class is spread all over Jerkar APIs.
   
* `JkPathTreeSet` : A set of `JkPathTree`.
