# This file declares some dependencies to be included to the project dependencies.
# They will be added and won't replace dependencies that have been declared by other means.
#
# REGULAR         : stands for dependencies used both for compilation and runtime.
#                   This is the most common place to declare dependencies.
# COMPILE_ONLY    : stands for dependencies used for compilation only (not for runtime).
# RUNTIME_ONLY    : stands for dependencies used for runtime only (not for compilation).
#                   Runtime dependencies has impact when creating fat jars and for the definition of published dependencies.
# TEST            : stands for dependencies used only for testing.
# VERSIONS        : Only
#
# Dependencies has to be declared using format as 'group:module:[classifier]:[type]:[version]'
# where 'classifier', 'type' and 'version' are optional (see JkCoordinate.of(String description) for details).
#
# Example :
#
# == TEST ==
#  org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test
#  org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-chrome-driver:3.4.0
#  org.junit:junit-bom:5.9.0::pom:5.9.0   (for Bill Of Material)
#  org.lwjgl:lwjgl:natives-linux::        (for classifier 'native-linux', default extension and default version)
#
# == VERSIONS ==
# org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.1.0
