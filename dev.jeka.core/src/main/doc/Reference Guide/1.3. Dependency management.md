## Dependency Management

### Concepts

#### What is a dependency ?

For Jeka, a _dependency_ is something that can be resolved to a set of files by a `JkDependencyResolver`.
Generally a dependency is resolved to 1 file (or forlder) but it can be 0 or many.

A dependency is always an instance of `JkDependency`.

Jeka distinguishes 3 types of dependency :

* __Arbitrary files__ located on the file system (represented by `JkFileSystemDependency` class). These files are assumed to be present on the file system when the build is running.
* __Files produced by a computation__ (represented by `JkComputedDependency` class). These files may be present on file system or not. If they are not present, the computation is run in order to produce the missing files. Generally the computation stands for the build of an external project.
* __Reference to module__ (represented by `JkModuleDependency`) hosted in a binary repository (Ivy or Maven for instance) : Jeka can consume and resolve transitively any artifact located in a repository as you would do with Maven, Ivy or Gradle.

For the last, Jeka is using _Ivy 2.5.0_ under the hood. 
This library is embedded inside the Jeka jar and is executed in a dedicated classloader. 
So all happens as if there where no dependency at all.

#### What is a scope ?

Projects may need dependencies to accomplish certain tasks and these dependencies may vary according the executed tasks.
For example, to _compile_ you may need _guava_ library only but to _test_ you'll need _junit_ library too. 
To tag dependencies according their usage, Jeka uses the notion of _scope_ (represented by `JkScope` class). This notion is similar to the Maven scope.

A scope can _inherit_ from one or several scopes. This means that if a scope _Foo_ inherits from scope _Bar_ then a dependencies declared with scope _Bar_ will be also considered as declared with scope _Foo_.
For instance, in `JkJavaBuild`, scope `TEST` inherits from `RUNTIME` that inherits from `COMPILE` so every dependencies declared with scope `COMPILE` are considered to be declared with scope `RUNTIME` and `TEST` as well.   

By default, scopes are _transitive_. This has only a meaning for _module dependencies_. 
If we have 3 modules having the following dependency scheme : `A` -> `B` -> `C` and the `A`-> `B` dependency is declared with a _non transitive scope_, then `A` won't depend from `C`. 
  
`JkJavaDepScope` class pre-defines scopes used in Java projects. 

**Scope Mapping** : Projects consuming artifacts coming from Ivy repository can also use `JkScopeMapping` which is more powerful. 
This notion maps strictly to the [Ivy configuration](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.2.0/ivyfile/configurations.html) concept.

#### What is a scoped dependency ?

A _scoped dependency_ (represented by `JkScopedDependency` class) is simply a dependency associated with zero, one or many scopes.
  
  
### Define a set of dependencies

To define a set of dependencies (typically the dependencies of the project to build), you basically define a set of _scoped dependencies_.

The set of scoped dependencies concept is represented by `JkDependencySet` class. This class provides a fluent API for easier instantiation. 

```Java
import static dev.jeka.core.api.depmanagement.JkJavaDepScopes.*;
...
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and("com.google.guava") 
    .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple")
    .and("com.orientechnologies:orientdb-client:2.0.8")
    .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST)
    .and("org.mockito:mockito-all:1.9.5", TEST)
    .andFile("../libs.myjar")
    .withVersionProvider(myVersionProvider)
    .withDefaultScopes(COMPILE);
```

Note that :

* Module version and scopes can be omitted when declaring dependencies. Versions can be provided by a `JkVersionProvider` 
and scopes can be defaulted.

* Instances of `JkDependencySet` can be combined together in order to construct large dependencySet from smaller ones.

* `JkDependencySet#ofTextDescription` provides a mean to instantiate a dependency set from a simple text as :
```
- COMPILE RUNTIME
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

- RUNTIME
com.h2database:h2
org.liquibase:liquibase-core
com.oracle:ojdbc6:12.1.0

- TEST
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test
org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-chrome-driver:3.4.0
org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-assertj:3.2.0
org.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-junit:3.2.0

- PROVIDED
org.projectlombok:lombok:1.16.16
```


### HHierarchy of Dependency Types.

* `JkModuleDependency` : Dependency on Maven modules
* `JkFileDependency` (Abstract): Dependency on files to be found on file system
    * `JkComputedDependency` : Dependency on files produced by the execution of a `Runnable`.
    * `JkFileSystemDependency` : Dependency on files supposed to already exist on file system.
     

#### Dependencies on Module

This is for declaring a dependency on module hosted in _Maven_ or _Ivy_ repository. Basically you instantiate a `JkModuleDepency` from it's group, name and version.

```Java
    JkDependencySet.of()
        .and(JkPopularModule.GUAVA, "18.0")
        .and("com.orientechnologies:orientdb-client:[2.0.8, 2.1.0[")
        .and("mygroup:mymodule:myclassifier:0.2-SNAPSHOT");
```
There is many way to indicate a module dependency, see Javadoc for browsing possibilities. 

Note that :
* A version ending by `-SNAPSHOT` has a special meaning : Jeka will consider it _"changing"_. This means that it won't cache it locally and will download the latest version from repository.  
* As Jeka relies on Ivy under the hood, it accepts dynamic versions as mentioned [here](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/dependency.html).
* Dependency files are downloaded in _[USER HOME]_/.jeka/cache/repo

#### Dependencies on local files

You just have to mention the path of one or several files. If one of the files does not exist at resolution time (when the dependency is actually retrieved), build fails.

```Java
    JkDependencySet of()
        .andFile("libs/my.jar")
        .andFile("libs/my.testingtool.jar", TEST);
    }
		
``` 

#### Dependencies on files produced by computation

It is typically used for _multi-modules_ or _multi-techno_ projects.

The principle is that if the specified files are not found, then the computation is run in order to generate the missing files.
If some files still missing after the computation has run, the build fails.

This mechanism is quite simple yet powerful as it addresses following use cases :

* Dependencies on files produced by an artifact producer (`JkArtifactProducer`). A Jeka Java project is an artifact producer.
* Dependencies on files produced by external project built with any type of technology (Ant, Grunt, Maven, Gradle, SBT, Android SDK, Make, ...).
* Dependencies on files produced by any means.   

The generic way is to construct this kind of dependency using a `java.lang.Runnable`.

The following snippet constructs a set of dependencies on two external projects : one is built with Maven, the other with 
_Jeka_. 
```Java
Path mavenProject = Paths.get("../a-maven-project");
JkProcess mavenBuild = JkProcess.of("mvn", "clean", "install").withWorkingDir(mavenProject);
Path mavenProjectJar = mavenProject.resolve("target/maven-project.jar");
JkJavaProject externalProject = JkJavaProject.ofSimple(Paths.get("../a-jeka-project")); 
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and(JkComputedDependency.of(mavenBuild, mavenProjectJar))
    .and(externalProject);
```

### Resolve Dependencies

The `JkDependencyResolver` class is responsible JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral());to resolve dependencies by returning `JkResolveResult` from a 
`JkdependencySet`. 

```java
JkDependencySet deps =  JkDependencySet
                            .of("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.3")
                            .andFile("libs/my.jar");

// Module dependencies are fetched from Maven central repo
JkDependencyResolver resolver = JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral());  
JkResolveResult result = resolver().resolve(deps);
```

From the result you can : 

* Navigate in the resolved dependency tree as :

```java
JkDependencyNode slfjApiNodeDep = result.getDependencyTree().getFirst(JkModuleId.of("org.slf4j:slf4j-api"));
System.out.println(slfjApiNode.getModuleInfo().getResolvedVersion());
```

* Get the direct list of artifact files

```java
JkPathSequence sequence = result.getFiles();  
sequence.forEach(System.out::println); // print each files part of the dependency resolution
```

* Resolve for a given scope

The following snippets captures the resolved dependency files for COMPILE scope. Junit is excluded from this result.
```
JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
    .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
    .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);
    
Iterable<Path> files = JkDependencyResolver.of(JkRepo.ofMavenCentral()).resolve(COMPILE).getFiles();
```

### Publication

Jeka is able to publish on both Maven and Ivy repository. This includes repositories as [Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/) or [Jfrog Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/).

Maven and Ivy have different publication model, so Jeka proposes specific APIs according you want to publish on a Maven or Ivy repository. 

#### Publish to a Maven repository

Jeka proposes a complete API to pubish on Maven repository. POM files will be generated by Jeka according 
provided elements.

The following snippet demonstrate a pretty sophisticated publishing on Maven :

```java
    JkVersionedModule versionedModule = JkVersionedModule.of("org.myorg:mylib:1.2.6");
    JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
            .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
            .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);
    JkMavenPublication mavenPublication = JkMavenPublication.of(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib.jar"))

            // the following are optional but required to publish on public repositories.
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-sources.jar"), "sources")
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-javadoc.jar"), "javadoc")
            .withChecksums("sha-2", "md5")
            .withSigner(JkPgp.of(Paths.get("myPubring"), Paths.get("mySecretRing"), "mypassword"))
            .with(JkMavenPublicationInfo.of("My sample project",
                    "A project to demonstrate publishing on Jeka",
                    "http://project.jeka.org")
                    .andApache2License()
                    .andDeveloper("djeang", "myemail@gmail.com", "jeka.org", "http://project.jeka.org/"));

    // A complex case for repo (credential + signature + filtering) 
    JkRepo repo = JkRepo.of("http://myserver/myrepo")
            .withOptionalCredentials("myUserName", "myPassword")
            .with(JkRepo.JkPublishConfig.of()
                        .withUniqueSnapshot(false)
                        .withNeedSignature(true)
                        .withFilter(mod -> // only accept SNAPSHOT and MILESTONE
                            mod.getVersion().isSnapshot() || mod.getVersion().getValue().endsWith("MILESTONE")
                        ));
    
    // Actually publish the artifacts
    JkPublisher publisher = JkPublisher.of(repo);
    publisher.publishMaven(versionedModule, mavenPublication, deps);
```

Notice that Jeka allows to :

- Publish more than one artifact.
- Produce & publish checksum files for each published artifact.
- Mention to use unique snapshot ([What is it ?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1243574/how-to-stop-maven-artifactory-from-keeping-snapshots-with-timestamps)).
- Feed generated pom with data necessary to publish on [central repository](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html).
- Sign published artifact with PGP
- Publish to multiple repository by creating the publisher using a `JkRepoSet` instead of a `JkRepo`.

To sign with PGP, no need to have PGP installed on Jeka machine. Jeka uses <a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/">Bouncy Castle</a> internally to sign artifacts.

#### Publish to a Ivy repository

Publishing on Ivy repo is pretty similar than on Maven though there is specific options to Ivy. 

```java
    JkVersionedModule versionedModule = JkVersionedModule.of("org.myorg:mylib:1.2.6-SNAPSHOT");
    JkDependencySet deps = JkDependencySet.of()
            .and("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple", COMPILE_AND_RUNTIME)
            .and("junit:junit:4.11", TEST);

    JkIvyPublication publication = JkIvyPublication.of(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib.jar"), "master")
            .and(Paths.get("org.myorg.mylib-sources.jar"));

    JkRepo repo = JkRepo.ofIvy(Paths.get("ivyrepo"));

    JkPublisher publisher = JkPublisher.of(repo);
    publisher.publishIvy(versionedModule, publication, deps, JkJavaDepScopes.DEFAULT_SCOPE_MAPPING,
            Instant.now(), JkVersionProvider.of());
```
