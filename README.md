Jerkar is a complete **Java** built system ala _Ant_, _Maven_, _Gradle_ or _Buildr_ but using **pure Java** to describe builds : no XML, no foreign language.
Breaking a common belief, it makes proof that Java is perfectly suitable in this domain.

See [official web site](http://jerkar.github.io) for more description.

# How to build Jerkar ?

Jerkar builds with itself and this is not a trivial case cause it involves multi-project, distribution crafting, 
manifest updating and Maven publication. So you may look here to get deeper understanding: [how to build Jerkar](doc/readme-parts/build-jerkar.md) and  See [how to quick start](doc/readme-parts/quick-start.md)

Also see [an example on how jerkar build itself](doc/readme-parts/example-jerkar-core.md)

# Status

The documentation is at its very early stage but the code is yet pretty close to completion for a first release. 
I mainly need help for further testing, writing documentation, polishing the API... and getting some feedback of course.
