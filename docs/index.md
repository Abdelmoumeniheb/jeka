# Welcome to Jeka

Jeka is a general-purpose build tool designed as a library. In other words, users describe programmatically 
the actions needed to achieve automation tasks, as they would do for regular code.

The library is designed to make complex common tasks as compiling, testing or resolving dependencies as concise as possible,
so building projects may require less typing compare to other tools you may know, with simplicity and transparency as 
a bonus.

_Jeka_ automation code can be run indifferently from IDE (via classic `main` method) or command line, thanks 
to a bundled lean and fast execution engine. This engine comes with a small set of concepts promoting simplicity,
flexibility and re-usability.
